#Hangman Game
''' Game to guess the word.
 1) The user needs to be able to input letter guesses.
 2) A limit should also be set on how many guesses they can use.
 3) Keep notifying the user of the remaining turns.
Text file will be used for words. There will also be a check if the user has actually inputed
a single letter, to check if the inputted is in the hidden word (and if it is, how many times
it appears), to print letters, and a count variable to limit guesses.
